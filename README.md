# Monopoly
Monopoly created in C++
<br />
<br />
Overview
<br />
<br />
This C++ program simulates a simplified version of the classic Monopoly board game. Players can choose to start a new game or load a saved game, roll dice to move around the board, buy properties, pay rent, and manage their finances. The game continues until only one player is left with money, declaring them the winner.

Features
<br />
- Player Management: Supports 2 to 8 players.
- Board Initialization: Sets up a basic Monopoly board with properties, utilities, and special spaces.
- Dice Rolling: Simulates dice rolls to move players around the board.
- Property Transactions: Players can buy properties, pay rent, and handle property ownership.
- Jail System: Players can go to jail and have the option to pay to get out.
- Save and Load: Players can save their game state to a file and load it later to continue playing.
- Bankruptcy: Players go bankrupt if their money drops below zero, and the game ends when only one player is left with money.
  
Files
<br />
- monopoly.cpp: The main source code file containing the game logic.
- monopoly_save.txt: The file where the game state is saved and loaded from.

Save and Load Functionality
<br />
- The game can be saved to monopoly_save.txt, storing player states and board information.
- The game can be loaded from monopoly_save.txt to resume from the last saved state.

Conclusion
<br />
<br />
This Monopoly game simulation provides a basic but functional implementation of the classic board game. Players can experience the core mechanics of Monopoly, including buying properties, paying rent, and managing their finances, all within a simple C++ program.
